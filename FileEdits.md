## Linux Basics
These are changes we need to make to the files for the lab:

  **pirate_snowy**
  : Change the line about find/replace in vim being not case sensitive. (It IS case sensitive by default.)
  
  **dreadpirate_instructions**
  : Read through the instructions and check that all the commands work. There seems to have been some differences in vim on the VMS.
  
  ## Shell Scripting
  **hangman**
  : If you lose, and you choose to play again, it doesn't work. The loop only checks if 'while word != match'
