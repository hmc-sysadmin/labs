# Shell Scripting in Bash
*Originally created by Lisa Goeller, Jo≈æi McKiernan, and Paige Rinnert*

## TODO
  - Double-check readings

## Readings

Before beginning this lab, you'll probably want to do read up on shell
scripting. These readings come from the book *The Linux Command Line: A Complete
Introduction* by William Shotts.

**Strongly recommended**

  - Chapters 24-25 (p. 309--324) provide some background on setting and using 
    variables.
  - Chapters 26-29 (p. 325--362) discuss functions, if/else branching, keyboard 
    input, and while/until loops.

*Additional reading*

  - Chapter 31 (p. 375--380) talks about case branching, which will be useful 
    for the extra credit.

## Introduction

The goal of this lab is to write a program in bash to play Hangman! **Pair
programming is highly encouraged for this lab.** 

Bash is a scripting language. There are different kinds of shells (like sh, zsh,
and csh) but we will just be working in bash, which stands for **b**ourne
**a**gain **sh**ell (so named because it replaced sh, the original Bourne
shell).

To do this lab, you need to be familiar with constructing if/else statements and
while/until loops. You should also be fairly comfortable with regular
expressions. Don't be afraid to use Google to look up syntax that you are unsure
about! This [Bash cheat sheet](http://www.johnstowers.co.nz/blog/pages/bash-cheat-sheet.html) might also help.

## Materials

You'll need two files: [`hangman_lab`][Hangman] and [`dict`][Dictionary].  The
`hangman_lab` file contains the beginning of a script that implements hangman.
You'll modify this file as part of the lab. The `dict` file contains words that
the game can use; each line of the files contains a word.

There are two ways to get the files onto your VM:

Download the files directly to your VM.
  : Log into your VM. In your home directory, use the `wget` command, along with
    the file URLs. Click on the links for the files above to visit the URLS, then
    copy the URL and run the command `wget <URL>`.

Download the files to your computer, then upload them to your VM.
  : Click the links for the files above, then save them to your computer. Use
    the `scp` command to upload them from your machine to your VM, like so: `scp
    <file> <username>@vm<#>.sys.cs.hmc.edu:~/`. This command will place the
    files in your home directory on your VM. Note: Your browser might try to add
    a .txt extension to the files. If so, you should remove the extension.

Notice that the `hangman_lab` file starts with a *"shebang"*:
```
#! /bin/bash
```
This line describes how to execute it: using the bash shell.

## Running a script

There are many ways to run a script or program in a *nix system. For this lab,
we'll run the hangman script as an executable file. To do so:

   1. Make sure the `hangman_lab` has executable permissions (see the [previous
   lab][Permissions] if you need a reminder for how to do this).
   1. Run the command `./hangman_lab`

In general, to run an executable file, you run the filename as if it were a
command. For example, `./hangman_lab` or `~/hangman_lab`. 

You can avoid typing the full path to the program, if the program's directory 
is in your path. The path is set by the `$PATH` variable in your environment. 
If the script is in a directory on your path, you will be able to run it by 
typing only the name of the script on the command line. For example, `ls`. 
To find out what directories are part of your path, type `echo $PATH` on
your command line. It will produce a colon-delimited list of directories
on your path. 

<!--
Throughout the process of writing the script, you can check periodically
that it is working by running it and seeing if the behavior is what you
expected. Be sure that any incomplete lines of code are commented out so
they don't return errors. Feel free to add print statements throughout
to help with debugging.
-->

## Defining Variables

Start off by completing the function `define` that defines the necessary
variables. We have defined three of them for you: `word`, `length`, and
`wip`. The `word` is selected randomly from the provided dictionary
using the command `shuf`, which shuffles the dictionary and returns the
first line (a single word). (NOTE: You need to add the pathway to the
file `dict`!)The length of the word needs to be defined so that it can
be referenced in `wip` (the word in progress). The word in progress
begins as simply underscores representing each letter of the word, and
this will become the "board" for the game.

The variables you need to add are `lives` and `gl`. `lives` will be the
number of lives the player gets before they lose the game. In our
example we gave 8 lives to the player. `gl` is an empty array that will
eventually contain the letters that the player has guessed. An array,
which is similar to a list, is represented by parentheses: `()`. A note
about setting variables is that bash cares about whitespace. There
shouldn't be any space between the variable and its value, like this:
`variable=value`.

Remember that to refer to variables in bash, the syntax is `$variable`.
If you want to include a character directly after the variable (for
example a period at the end of a sentence), include curly brackets
around the variable: `${variable}`. To reference arrays, in addition to
the \$ and curly brackets, you need to tell the shell to look at all
elements of the array: `${array[@]}`. If you are setting the results of
a command to a variable, like in `word`, `length`, and `wip`, the
command needs to be enclosed in parentheses and then preceded by a \$,
like this: `variable=$(command)`.

## Get user input for letter


The function you will write next is called `get_letter`. (Instead of
writing the functions in the order they will be called, which is the
order they appear in the file, we encourage you to write them in the
order they appear in this handout.) The main job of this function is to
ask the user to input a letter. There are three parts to the function:
first you print a string to tell the user what to enter, next comes the
command to read the user's input, and finally the function calls
`valid_letter` to determine if the input was valid.

Remember the print command in bash is `echo`. The command to ask for
user input is `read` and the syntax is `read <variable>`. In this case,
we will call the variable `letter`. After adding code to a function,
it's okay to remove the `return` statements.

## Check that letter is valid


The next function you should write is called `valid_letter` and
(surprisingly) checks whether the user input for `letter` is valid.
Valid inputs consist of lowercase Roman alphabet characters only. If the
input is valid, the script should call the function `guessed_letter`.
(We have written this function for you because the syntax is kind of
obscure.) After the `if` condition include a semicolon followed by the
word `then`.

If the input is invalid, there should be an `else` statement where the
script prompts for another letter by calling `get_letter`. You might
consider printing some additional helpful information for your user,
such as a reminder of what letters have been guessed and what the word
looks like now. At the end of the `else` statement, you need to type
`fi` to close the entire if/else section.

## Check if the letter has been guessed


We wrote this function, `guessed_letter`, for you because the syntax is
bizarre. The goal of this function is to check if the user has already
guessed the letter. If the user has guessed it, the function returns to
`get_letter` to ask for a different letter. If not, the function adds
the letter to the array `gl` which contains guessed letters, and it
calls `letter_in_word` to determine whether the letter is in the word.

## Check that the letter is in the word


This function, `letter_in_word`, checks whether the letter is in the
given word. There should be an `if` case for if the letter is in the
word, and an `else` case for if it is not.

For the `if` case, use regular expressions to check whether the string
`$word` contains the string `$letter`. Inside this `if` statement,
update the variable `$wip` to include the newly guessed letter. To do
this, we will use a find and replace command within a string. We want to
replace all characters in `$word` NOT found in the guessed letters list
with underscores. This is slightly counterinuitive but it works. The
syntax of the find and replace command for strings in bash is
`${string//pattern/replacement}`. Use regex to specify the pattern.
Don't forget to include any text you want to display, like the newly
updated board and the letters that have been guessed.

For the `else` case, we don't need to make any changes to `$wip` because
the letter isn't in the word. However, we do need to decrement the
number of lives. You will need to use double parentheses (( )) to create
a math environment, with a \$ in front of them to mark it as a variable.
You also need to call `check_lives` to determine whether the user still
has lives left or if the game is over. (You will write this function
later.) Don't forget `fi`.

## Write game function


You will now need to write a function `game` that prompts the user for
letters until the word is guessed. In order to have an effective game,
you first need to define your variables (funny, I think you wrote a
function for that already). You also need to let the player know how
long the word is by printing the board. Then, you need to keep asking
for letters until the word-in-progress is the same as the word itself.
(Remember, an `until` loop requires `do` at the beginning and `done`
when it is finished.) When the word is guessed, the user should be asked
if they want to play again. Their `answer` should be read in.

## Check number of lives remaining


Now you will need to check to see if the player has any lives remaining.
You can do this by writing an `if` statement. If the player has no lives
remaining, you should give them `$word` (just to be nice) and the option
to play again if they so wish. Otherwise, the player should just keep
playing. If the player decides to play again, both the word and the
variables need to be reset.

## Putting it all together


Now that you've defined the functions, you should call them, assuming
that the user wants to play. (Hint: Try using a while loop!) Consider
how all the functions can work together to allow the game to actually
work.

Now you're ready to run the script and test your game!

## Extra Credit :)


If you still have some time left over, you can write a starting menu
that offers the option for the player to play in single-player mode or
against a friend. To write a menu, look at `case` branching (see Chapter
31 of the Linux book). It is within these branches that you should
define `$word`, whether it should be retrieved randomly from a
dictionary or whether it should be inputted into the game.

Also, if you are so inclined, you can try including ASCII art of a
hangman (or something less grotesque) that updates throughout the game.
Another idea is to create a cheating function that allows the player to
search through the dictionary with regex for possible matches to the
letters they've already guessed in the word. Play around, have fun, and
happy scripting!
