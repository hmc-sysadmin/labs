The writeups are written in Markdown. In particular, they're written with a
version of Markdown called [Madoko]. To work on the writeups:

  1. [Install Madoko]
  1. Edit the writeups
  1. Generate an HTML version of the writeup with the following command:
```
madoko -v <file>
```
  1. Commit and push your changes back to GitHub

Note: you don't *technically* need to install Madoko to work on the labs. The
Markdown should be easy enough to edit as-is. But installing Madoko will help
you check that the HTML version will look like it's supposed to.
