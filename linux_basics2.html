<p data-line="13"><span data-line=":13"></span>Every file has a ten-character string that defines its attributes. This

<p data-line="21"><span data-line=":21"></span>The command <span data-line=":21"></span><code class="code">ls -l</code><span data-line=":21"></span> shows other useful information, such as the creator of
the file (blackbeard), the group that owns the file (users), and the
size of the file in bytes (3000), but here we are just going to focus on
the permissions.
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="26"><span data-line=":26"></span>The first character in the string <span data-line=":26"></span><code class="code">-rwxrâ€“rw-</code><span data-line=":26"></span> gives its file type: 
<span data-line=":27"></span><code class="code">-</code><span data-line=":27"></span> tells us that this is a regular file.
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="29"><span data-line=":29"></span>The other nine characters represent the file<span data-line=":29"></span>&#39;<span data-line=":29"></span>s mode. Characters two

(<span data-line=":32"></span><code class="code">rw-</code><span data-line=":32"></span>) represent the world permissions, the permissions of everyone else.
The permissions of the mode can be represented by three characters:

<p data-line="62"><span data-line=":62"></span>The permissions of a file will most often be 0 or 4-7 in the octal
representation.
</p>
<p class="indent para-continue" data-line="65"><span data-line=":65"></span>The <span data-line=":65"></span><code class="code">umask</code><span data-line=":65"></span> command sets the default permissions given to
newly created files. When files are created, the default permissions are 666.
Running <span data-line=":67"></span><code class="code">umask 0000</code><span data-line=":67"></span> would set the default permissions for new files to 666,
which is rw-rw-rw-. The 000 means that none of the permissions are masked.
(Ignore the first digit for now because it is only used for special modes).
Changing the value of umask will mask permissions. For example, if you
set umask to 0066, you will change the default file permissions to 600,
which means that only the file creator can read, write, and execute the file.
</p>
<ul class="compact" data-line="74">
<li data-line="74"><span data-line=":74"></span>Run <span data-line=":74"></span><code class="code">umask</code><span data-line=":74"></span> to see what the current default permissions are. Under
these default permissions, what are world users allowed to do?
</li></ul>

<p class="para-continue" data-line="77"><span data-line=":77"></span>OK, so now we know the default settings. But what if we wanted to change
the permissions of an already existing file? There are several
techniques for changing file permissions.
</p>
<ol class="loose" data-line="81">
<li data-line="81">
<p data-line="81"><span data-line=":81"></span>Using <span data-line=":81"></span><code class="code">chmod</code><span data-line=":81"></span>
</p>
<pre class="para-block fenced para-block" data-line="82" data-line-code="83"><code data-line="83">chmod &lt;octal #&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</code></pre>
<p data-line="85"><span data-line=":85"></span>With octal representation, you can change the file<span data-line=":85"></span>&#39;<span data-line=":85"></span>s mode. For
example, if you were to input:
</p>
<pre class="para-block fenced para-block" data-line="87" data-line-code="88"><code data-line="88">chmod 600 MINE.txt</code></pre>
<p data-line="90"><span data-line=":90"></span>This would set the permissions of the file MINE.txt so that only the
owner would be able to read and write the file.
</p></li>
<li data-line="93">
<p data-line="93"><span data-line=":93"></span>Using <span data-line=":93"></span><code class="code">chown</code><span data-line=":93"></span>
</p>
<pre class="para-block fenced para-block" data-line="94" data-line-code="95"><code data-line="95">chown &lt;name&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</code></pre>
<p data-line="97"><span data-line=":97"></span>This changes the ownership of the file to the specified user.
</p>
<pre class="para-block fenced para-block" data-line="98" data-line-code="99"><code data-line="99">chown :&lt;group&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</code></pre>
<p data-line="101"><span data-line=":101"></span>This command changes the group ownership to the group <span data-line=":101"></span><code class="code">&lt;group&gt;</code><span data-line=":101"></span>.
Note that you can use a combination of these two commands to change
both individual and group owners at the same time:
</p>
<pre class="para-block fenced para-block" data-line="104" data-line-code="105"><code data-line="105">chown &lt;name&gt;:&lt;group&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</code></pre></li></ol>
<h2 id="su-and-sudo" class="unnumbered"  data-line="108" ><span data-line=":108"></span>SU and SUDO</h2>
<p data-line="110"><span data-line=":110"></span>If you try running chown or chmod on a file that you don<span data-line=":110"></span>&#39;<span data-line=":110"></span>t own, you<span data-line=":110"></span>&#39;<span data-line=":110"></span>ll
notice that <span data-line=":111"></span><em>you can&#39;t</em><span data-line=":111"></span>. The only way to do this is to become another
user. To become another user, run the following command:
</p>
<pre class="para-block fenced para-block" data-line="113" data-line-code="114"><code data-line="114">su &lt;user&gt;</code></pre>
<p data-line="116"><span data-line=":116"></span>You will then be prompted for the user<span data-line=":116"></span>&#39;<span data-line=":116"></span>s password. If you do not include
a username, the command line will assume that you wish to become the
superuser. The superuser has power over everything and can change all
permissions.
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="121"><span data-line=":121"></span>To stop being a user in su, simply type exit into the command line and
hit enter.
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="124"><span data-line=":124"></span>To run a single command using su, simply type:
</p>
<pre class="para-block fenced para-block" data-line="125" data-line-code="126"><code data-line="126">su -c &lt;command&gt;</code></pre>
<p data-line="128"><span data-line=":128"></span>The sudo command also allows a user to get more privileges, but in a
much more controlled way. Because the administrator configures sudo, a
user using sudo may not have full superuser powers. Sudo differs from su
in that sudo usually requires a user<span data-line=":131"></span>&#39;<span data-line=":131"></span>s own password rather than the
root<span data-line=":132"></span>&#39;<span data-line=":132"></span>s. Thus, sudo is a much safer command than su. The sudo syntax
looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="para-block fenced para-block" data-line="134" data-line-code="135"><code data-line="135">sudo &lt;command&gt;</code></pre>
<p class="para-continue" data-line="137"><span data-line=":137"></span>It is here that we as the CS Department remind you once again, <span data-line=":137"></span>&#8220;&#8221;<span data-line=":137"></span>With
great power, comes great responsibility.<span data-line=":138"></span>&quot;<span data-line=":138"></span> Like Spiderman, when becoming
the superuser you become more than the average human. We only hope that
you continue to use your powers for good.

</p><h2 id="treasure-hunt"  data-line="157" ><span data-line=":157"></span>Treasure Hunt!</h2>
<p data-line="159"><span data-line=":159"></span>There is some treasure hidden on your machine, and we want to help you find it!
In this part of the lab, we<span data-line=":160"></span>&#39;<span data-line=":160"></span>ll chart a course through a map to your treasure. 
Each step along the way may requre the use of a new tool: regular expressions.
</p><h3 id="regular-expressions"  data-line="163" ><span data-line=":163"></span>Regular Expressions</h3>
<p data-line="165"><span data-line=":165"></span>Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching. In fact,
you were already using regular expressions when you ran the grep
command! If you learn how to use regular expressions, you can match much
more than just words; you will be able to match patterns like every word
that starts with a j, or every file that contains a number in its name.<span data-line=":169"></span><br>
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="171"><span data-line=":171"></span>Two programs that are commonly used with regular expressions are awk and
sed. Awk is an interpreted language that is very good at processing text
with regular expressions. Sed stands for <span data-line=":173"></span>&#8220;stream editor&#8221;<span data-line=":173"></span> and is a
UNIX utility that allows the user to process files. The main difference
between the two is that sed is simpler and easier to use to edit text
while awk is a programming language in and of itself (vaguely similar to
C) that can do a lot more than just edit text. If you are interested,
you can research more about the history and use of awk and sed.<span data-line=":178"></span><br>
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="180"><span data-line=":180"></span>In this lab, you will mostly be using the sed command. You are
encouraged to read the sed man page to learn more about how the command
works and to get comfortable with the available options. Two option
flags you should definitely know about are<span data-line=":183"></span> <span data-line=":183"></span>-i and<span data-line=":183"></span> <span data-line=":183"></span>-e. The<span data-line=":183"></span> <span data-line=":183"></span>-e command
will make the changes to the file and output the altered file to the
command line without changing the saved version of the file. The<span data-line=":185"></span> <span data-line=":185"></span>-i
option will edit the file in place.<span data-line=":186"></span><br>
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="188"><span data-line=":188"></span>The regular expression metacharacters are <span data-line=":188"></span>^<span data-line=":188"></span> <span data-line=":188"></span>*<span data-line=":188"></span> <span data-line=":188"></span>-<span data-line=":188"></span> [ ]<span data-line=":188"></span> <span data-line=":188"></span>\<span data-line=":188"></span>{ } ?<span data-line=":188"></span> <span data-line=":188"></span>+ ( ) .
and |.<span data-line=":189"></span><br>
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="191"><span data-line=":191"></span>They each have different meanings. For example, <span data-line=":191"></span>^<span data-line=":191"></span> anchors the beginning
of a line and <span data-line=":192"></span>$<span data-line=":192"></span> anchors the end of a line. The . is a character
placeholder, so it could be replaced by any character. So, the regular
expression<span data-line=":194"></span><br>
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="196"><span data-line=":196"></span><code class="code">&#39;^q..x.$&#39;</code><span data-line=":196"></span>
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="198"><span data-line=":198"></span>will match with any word that is five characters long, starts with a q
and whose second-to-last character is an x. Note that single quotes are
used to designate the regular expression as separate from any command.
If your pattern involves single quotes, you will want to surround your
regular expression with double quotes instead.<span data-line=":202"></span><br>
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="204"><span data-line=":204"></span>The<span data-line=":204"></span> [ ]<span data-line=":204"></span> characters allow you to designate multiple choices. So the
expression
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="207"><span data-line=":207"></span><code class="code">&#39;^[ABC]&#39;</code><span data-line=":207"></span>
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="209"><span data-line=":209"></span>will match any pattern that begins with a capital A, B, or C.<span data-line=":209"></span><br>
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="211"><span data-line=":211"></span>Obviously, this handout does not cover all there is to know about
regular expressions. It will just serve as an introduction. However,
regular expressions are very powerful and useful, so it is definitely
worth your time to learn more!<span data-line=":214"></span><br>
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="216"><span data-line=":216"></span>The clue that will lead you to the first step toward your treasure is hidden in
the file treasureisland. To decode the message, you will need to follow
the instructions exactly for the message to appear. It is recommended
that you save copies of your text file at different steps so that you
can go back if you make mistakes. Several .diff files have been provided
so you can check your progress.<span data-line=":221"></span><br>
</p>
<p class="indent para-continue" data-line="223"><span data-line=":223"></span>Start by making a copy of the file treasureisland to work on so that you
can keep a copy of the original for reference. (The file is located in
the <span data-line=":225"></span>~<span data-line=":225"></span>/LinuxBasics directory.)
</p>
<ol class="loose" data-line="227">
<li data-line="227">
<p data-line="227"><span data-line=":227"></span>It is often useful to perform find and replace operations on text
files. There is a simple sed command just for this purpose. Its
basic form is:
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="231"><code>sed -i &#39;s/&lt;find&gt;/&lt;replace&gt;/g&#39; file.txt</code></pre>
<p data-line="233"><span data-line=":233"></span>The<span data-line=":233"></span> <span data-line=":233"></span>-i option tells sed to edit the file in place. Replace
<span data-line=":234"></span><<span data-line=":234"></span>find<span data-line=":234"></span>><span data-line=":234"></span> with the pattern that you want to search for. This can be a
character or word, or using regular expressions, we can ask it to
search for many different patterns! Whatever should take the place
of the patterns should go in the position of <span data-line=":237"></span><<span data-line=":237"></span>replace<span data-line=":237"></span>><span data-line=":237"></span>. The
leading s stands for <span data-line=":238"></span>&#8220;substitute&#8221;<span data-line=":238"></span> and the trailing g stands for
<span data-line=":239"></span>&#8220;global.&#8221;<span data-line=":239"></span> If the g is left off, only the first instance of the
pattern in each line will be replaced.<span data-line=":240"></span><br>
</p>
<p data-line="242"><span data-line=":242"></span>So, to remove all the extraneous punctuation that are not single
quotes or periods and replace them with a space, we could use the
following command:
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="246"><code>sed -i &#39;s/[?!,:;&quot;-]/ /g&#39; treasureisland</code></pre>
<p data-line="248"><span data-line=":248"></span>Run this command now. If you like, it might be a good idea to run it
with the<span data-line=":249"></span> <span data-line=":249"></span>-e option first, so that you can see what will happen to
your file without actually changing it.
</p></li>
<li data-line="252">
<p data-line="252"><span data-line=":252"></span>To remove apostrophes and replace them with spaces, we need to
surround the regular expression with double quotes instead of single
quotes.
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="256"><code>sed -i &quot;s/&#39;/ /g&quot; treasureisland</code></pre>
<p data-line="258"><span data-line=":258"></span>Run this command now.
</p></li>
<li data-line="260">
<p data-line="260"><span data-line=":260"></span>It is also useful to remove entire lines of a file by line number.
If you want to quickly view the lines in a file, you can run
<span data-line=":262"></span><code class="code">cat -n &lt;filename&gt;</code><span data-line=":262"></span> which will display all of the lines in a file by
line number. It is also useful to pipe the cat command through less,
so that you can go back and view all the lines in a long file. The
regular expression that allows us to remove lines from a file has
the general form:
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="268"><code>sed -i &#39;&lt;line number&gt;d&#39; &lt;filename&gt;</code></pre>
<p data-line="270"><span data-line=":270"></span>To remove multiple consecutive lines, the command looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="272"><code>sed -i &#39;&lt;starting line number&gt;,&lt;ending line number&gt;d&#39; &lt;filename&gt;</code></pre>
<p data-line="274"><span data-line=":274"></span>It is even possible to remove several sets of consecutive lines by
using semicolons to separate the groups of lines that you want to
delete:
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="278"><code>sed -i &#39;&lt;line number&gt;d;&lt;starting line number&gt;,&lt;ending line number&gt;d&#39; &lt;filename&gt;</code></pre>
<p data-line="280"><span data-line=":280"></span>Note that a d is required after each grouping of lines that you want
to delete.
</p>
<p data-line="283"><span data-line=":283"></span>We want to remove lines 1-27 from treasureisland. Do this by running
the following:
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="286"><code>sed -i &#39;1,27d&#39; treasureisland</code></pre></li>
<li data-line="288">
<p data-line="288"><span data-line=":288"></span>Next, we will combine find-replace syntax with the delete command
and some more regular expression pattern matching to remove all
lines in the file that do not begin with uppercase or lowercase L,
T, K, A, or O. Do this now.
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="293"><code>sed -i &#39;/^[lLtTkKaAoO]/!d&#39; treasureisland</code></pre></li>
<li data-line="295">
<p data-line="295"><span data-line=":295"></span>The next step is to change the file so that all the characters are
lowercase. For this, it is easier to use awk. Awk does not have an
option to change a file in place, so we need to file the output into
a temporary file, then overwrite the old file with the contents of
the temporary file.
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="301"><code>awk &#39;{print tolower($0)}&#39; treasureisland &gt; tempfile &amp;&amp; mv tempfile treasureisland</code></pre></li>
<li data-line="303">
<p data-line="303"><span data-line=":303"></span>Next, delete all the periods in the file. You can use the find and
replace command to do this, just make sure to replace with nothing,
not with a space. Remember that a period is a metacharacter, so you
will need to use the escape character to find it like this: <span data-line=":306"></span>\<span data-line=":306"></span>.
</p></li>
<li data-line="308">
<p data-line="308"><span data-line=":308"></span>If we can remove specific lines, we should be able to add lines as
well. The basic format of this regular expression is:
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="311"><code>sed -i &#39;&lt;line number&gt;i &lt;string&gt;&#39; &lt;filename&gt;</code></pre>
<p data-line="313"><span data-line=":313"></span>Try it out by inserting the string <span data-line=":313"></span>&#8220;run&#8221;<span data-line=":313"></span> at line 9 in
treasureisland. Do not include the double quotes.
</p></li>
<li data-line="316">
<p data-line="316"><span data-line=":316"></span>Now, insert the string <span data-line=":316"></span>&#8220;/usr/local/&#8221;<span data-line=":316"></span> at line 8 in treasureisland.
It includes the / character, so you will need to use the escape
character within the string to access it.
</p>
<p data-line="320"><span data-line=":320"></span>If you would like to check your work at this point, there is a file
called regex<span data-line=":321"></span>_<span data-line=":321"></span>checks/step08check.txt stored in the directory. It contains the
correct file contents after the first eight steps. Check it against
your file using the diff command. Remember that you can read the
diff man page again to learn more about the command.
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="326"><code>diff </code></pre></li>
<li data-line="328">
<p data-line="328"><span data-line=":328"></span>Use the line removal command to remove lines 1-5, 11, 13-15, 17-34,
and 37. Be careful! You will need to remove all the lines at the
same time, or you might accidentally delete part of the clue.
</p>
<p data-line="332"><span data-line=":332"></span>There is another check file, called step09check.txt to check your
work after step 9.
</p></li>
<li data-line="335">
<p data-line="335"><span data-line=":335"></span>Now, separate the text file so that each word is on its own line. Do
this by replacing whitespace with a newline. Sed recognizes <span data-line=":336"></span>\<span data-line=":336"></span>s as
whitespace and <span data-line=":337"></span>\<span data-line=":337"></span>n as a newline.
</p>
<p data-line="339"><span data-line=":339"></span>Once again, a file for checking your work after this step is in the
directory at step10check.txt.
</p></li>
<li data-line="342">
<p data-line="342"><span data-line=":342"></span>Using the insertion syntax given above, insert a dash at line 74.
Now insert a dash at line 100.
</p></li>
<li data-line="345">
<p data-line="345"><span data-line=":345"></span>Insert a period at line 149. Remember that a period is a
metacharacter.
</p></li>
<li data-line="348">
<p data-line="348"><span data-line=":348"></span>Insert the character x at line 38.
</p></li>
<li data-line="350">
<p data-line="350"><span data-line=":350"></span>Next, remove the following lines: 1, 3-33, 35-36, 39-49, 51-58,
60-73, 76-87, 89-100, 102-120, and 122-149. Remember that you need
to delete them all at once.
</p>
<p data-line="354"><span data-line=":354"></span>There is a file for checking your work after this step called
step14check.txt.
</p></li>
<li data-line="357">
<p data-line="357"><span data-line=":357"></span>Another useful regular expression will append two lines together:
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="359"><code>sed -i &#39;N;s/\n/ /&#39; file.txt</code></pre>
<p data-line="361"><span data-line=":361"></span>This command is essentially replacing every newline character with a
space. The N at the beginning of the regular expression will append
the current line and the next line into the space of the pattern.
Run the above command once on the treasureisland.txt file.
</p></li>
<li data-line="366">
<p data-line="366"><span data-line=":366"></span>Some whitespace snuck into the file. Replace all instances of the
string <span data-line=":367"></span><code class="code">local/ </code><span data-line=":367"></span> with the string <span data-line=":367"></span><code class="code">local/</code><span data-line=":367"></span> using the global
find and replace command.
</p></li>
<li data-line="370">
<p data-line="370"><span data-line=":370"></span>Run the command that will append two lines together <span data-line=":370"></span><em>three more
times</em><span data-line=":371"></span>.
</p></li>
<li data-line="373">
<p data-line="373"><span data-line=":373"></span>Now, replace all instances of the string <span data-line=":373"></span><code class="code"> - </code><span data-line=":373"></span> with the string
<span data-line=":374"></span><code class="code">-</code><span data-line=":374"></span>. (The original string has two spaces around it. The new string should 
have no spaces around it.)
</p></li>
<li data-line="377">
<p data-line="377"><span data-line=":377"></span>Replace all instances of the string <span data-line=":377"></span><code class="code"> . </code><span data-line=":377"></span> with the string <span data-line=":377"></span><code class="code">.</code><span data-line=":377"></span>.
(The original string has two spaces around it. The new string should 
have no spaces around it.)
</p></li>
<li data-line="381">
<p data-line="381"><span data-line=":381"></span>Recall that in regular expressions, the <span data-line=":381"></span>$<span data-line=":381"></span> character represents the
end of a line and the . character represents one character. Use
these to write a regular expression that will delete the last two
characters from every line in the file.
</p></li>
<li data-line="386">
<p data-line="386"><span data-line=":386"></span>Now, replace any instance of <span data-line=":386"></span><code class="code">sh</code><span data-line=":386"></span> in the file with <span data-line=":386"></span><code class="code">py</code><span data-line=":386"></span>.
</p>
<p data-line="388"><span data-line=":388"></span>Open the file! If all went well, you will have a clue to send you to
the final step in the lab.
</p></li></ol>
<h2 id="executables"  data-line="391" ><span data-line=":391"></span>Executables</h2>
<p data-line="393"><span data-line=":393"></span>Now that you have found the location of the executable file, you should
run it. We will cover shell scripting and executables in another lab so
for now all you need to know is how to run a file. To run most shell
scripts, you will need to be in the same directory in the script, or
know a path to the script. Invoke the scripting language at the
beginning of the command line then the file name.
</p>
<p class="indent" data-line="400"><span data-line=":400"></span>For instance, to run a shell script called swabthedeck.sh, you would run
the command:
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="403"><code>sh swabthedeck.sh</code></pre>
<p data-line="405"><span data-line=":405"></span>Python and perl are also common scripting languages. To run a python
script called coconut.py, you would run the command:
</p>
<pre class="para-block para-block" data-line="408"><code>python coconut.py</code></pre>
<p data-line="410"><span data-line=":410"></span>Try it out with the executable that you just discovered and see what
happens!
